Birthday Wishes!

An idea to look at where birthday wishes come from. Yes, I wrote this on my Birthday.


Usage

Create your own "wishes.txt" file.
Create your own "YOUR_NAME_birthday.rb" file based on the "marks_birthday.rb" template
run 'ruby YOUR_NAME_birthday.rb"


Todo

Use twitter api to pull in wishes
Use facebook api to pull in wishes

But honestly, if you have enough friends/family where you can't enter these things manually and you HAVE to use the APIs...well then look at you...
